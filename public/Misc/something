I've been told by Jimi that I should create something involving images. 
My plan is to create a website? which has images which are scollable. Expand into a div. 

<b>Steps</b>
Post the images (check)
Create horizontal slider beneath the images (check) and limit the width of the container div so the slide bar is always shown.(width)
Use javascript to make images not selected grey (opaque) and image that is selected show. 
Include images in div tag by defauly with set sizes. Hide until corresponding small thumbnail image selected.
Make images scroll with timer anyway.
Allow selection to be done using left/right buttons. 
Do rest of site.
